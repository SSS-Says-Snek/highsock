Welcome to hisock's documentation!
==================================

hisock is a higher-level extension of the `socket` module,
with simpler and more efficient usages. It completely removes the hassle of headers, and
utilizes decorators to maintain a good code structure.

.. note::
   This project is still currently under development.
   This is also the first package of the developer, SSS_Says_Snek, so if you find something
   that needs improvement, submit an issue on the `GitHub Repository <https://github.com/SSS-Says-Snek/hisock/>`_
