Installation
============

There are two options when installing hisock:

1. You can download a zip of it on Github. It is located
`here <https://github.com/SSS-Says-Snek/hisock/>`_. You can either clone it with the website
or Github Desktop, but you can also clone it with Git:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/SSS-Says-Snek/hisock.git (Git)
        OR
    $ gh repo clone SSS-Says-Snek/hisock (GitHub CLI)

Then, copy-paste the module into your code, and it should work!

.. caution::
    This method of installing is **heavily** discouraged, unless you have modified
    hisock enough. However, if you had lots of modified changes, you could
    open a pull request on Github, and wait for me to approve it

2. You can install it via pip (RECOMMENDED). You can use the following command
in the terminal/command prompt:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m pip install hisock (Windows)
        OR
    $ pip3 install hisock (Mac/Linux)

Then, you have hisock installed to your python version! An extremely big plus of this
installation over the manual installation is that you are able to use it anywhere on
your computer, without cloning it into your directory.

.. warning::
    hisock is the first project I ever published to PyPI, so there might be some
    quirks on PyPI here and there, like the sudden burst of version post-releases.
    However, I will try to keep this at the bare minimum, and hopefully figure out
    PyPI good enough
