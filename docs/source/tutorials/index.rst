More Tutorials
--------------

These tutorials are aimed at people who have just finished the
:doc:`Quickstart Tutorial <../quickstart/beginner_tutorial>`, but want to learn more about ``hisock``.
As I've stated in the Quickstart Tutorial, it is not recommended, but necessary, to have a deeper
understanding of :mod:`hisock` to create more complex applications.
